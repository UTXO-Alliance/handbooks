# [UTXO model flavors handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L4eQSjC5SLY8iDSca1FJRrNy1Dwhr2aJ3I1Y-LhpTUk/edit?usp=sharing)

This handbook aims to be a digestible resource for introducing the UTXO model and its variants. Different members of the UTXO Alliance have opted for different designs for their main UTXO chain, the motivations and trade-offs are often very complex. With this handbook we aim to highlight the key differences rather than dwell on the decisions behind these. By utilizing elaborated visuals we can tell a consistent story: how to build a sound decentralized financial system? And how in this journey UTXO Alliance members face similar problems but implement different solutions.

This is the core premise for creating this visual handbook. We start with a brief description of what a blockchain is. Then we jump to explain the 6 core components (we are also calling them 'ingredients' analogous to the ones needed to make an ice cream recipe):
1. Cryptographic primitives
2. Transaction blocks
3. UTXO set & Ledger
4. Blocks
5. Consensus protocols
6. Network

## How to Contribute?
If you just want to add minimal feedback to the handbook, please go to the shared doc [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L4eQSjC5SLY8iDSca1FJRrNy1Dwhr2aJ3I1Y-LhpTUk/edit?usp=sharing) and request to be an editor (Note that you must be part of an Alliance member or a community member to be granted edit access).

Otherwise, if you would like to work on flowchart, diagrams and visuals. You can fork this repository. Head to the `flowcharts/` directory, download the `*.excalidraw` file you're interested in working on. Make local changes and then submit a PR. We are using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), a powerfull drawing web-app that has a free to use version but you have to make sure to save any changes before closing the app, otherwise you'll lose your progress.

*Note.- We are iterating fast on this project, thus you can expect fast updates on the handbook and visuals.*

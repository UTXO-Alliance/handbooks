# Goals
1. The "UTXO model flavors menu" [handbook](https://github.com/UTXO-Alliance/handbooks/blob/main/utxo-model-flavors-menu-v2.2.pdf) ims to be a presentation card of all the different chain designs of UTXO Alliance members. Aiming to be a handy resource for entrepreneurs, commercial partners and a general audience with minimal technical knowledge.
2. Explain the key aspects of the UTXO model and the functioning of a blockchain using simple visual flowcharts. 
3. Expose the rich variety of the different designs implemented by various blockchains that are part of the UTXO Alliance.

## Overview
It's been a decade since Bitcoin with its underlying computing model, the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, brought the most prominent application of blockchain technology to life - decentralized financial systems.

This seminal pioneer breakthrough inspired subsequent revolutions reimagining decentralized socio-economic systems. A second wave introduced smart contracts, which allows to put conditions on financial transactions written in verifiable code which then paves the path for decentralized applications (dApps) to emerge; and a third wave introduced self-governing mechanisms embedded in the system. Nowadays a competitive blockchain must offer a network protocol that meets all previous advancements plus have its roadmap heavily focused on maximizing the decentralization-security-scalability triad (aka. Blockchain trilemma) from research to tech-engineering.

While Bitcoin laid the groundwork with its UTXO model (think vanilla ice cream üç¶), the UTXO Alliance members have been cooking up some seriously cool flavors! From Cardano's eUTXO bringing smart contracts to the table, to Ergo's powerful scripting capabilities, to Alephium's sharding solution - each chain adds its own special ingredients to the mix. It's like having a whole ice cream parlor of blockchain designs to choose from! üç®

This is where our handbook comes in - think of it as your friendly neighborhood guide to the UTXO universe. Through colorful diagrams and clear explanations, we'll take you on a journey from Bitcoin's vanilla UTXO to the exotic flavors offered by modern UTXO-based chains. Whether you're a developer looking to build the next big dApp, an entrepreneur exploring blockchain solutions, or just someone curious about how these systems work, we've got you covered!

No complex math or cryptography background needed - just bring your curiosity and let us show you how UTXO-based blockchains are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in decentralized systems. Join us in exploring this tasty menu of blockchain innovation! üöÄ
